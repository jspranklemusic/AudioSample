# AudioSample
A simple, vanilla JS in-browser DAW for editing, recording, and mixing.

This is currently in the very early stages, with most of the functionality still needing to be added, and much refactoring needing to be done. Currently, this can:
1.) import multiple files
2.) play them back all at once
3.) remove clips from the timeline
4.) move the cursor to a position and have the file play

There is UI for other features, such as mute, solo, recording, and dragging clips across the timeline, but this is not functional yet.
