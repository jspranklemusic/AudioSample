This is currently in the very early stages, with most of the functionality still needing to be added, and much refactoring needing to be done. There is UI for other features, such as mute, solo, recording, and dragging clips across the timeline, but this is not functional yet.
Currently, the features that work are:

1.) import multiple files

2.) play them back all at once

3.) remove clips from the timeline

4.) move the cursor to a position and play at that location
